Hi!

I'm Cole Feely, a pursuing Sales Engineer with an aspiration of blending technology and business together! Before entering College, I always had an inner passion to think of ideas and bring them to life- at school, I accumulated the skills to bring my Computer Projects to life. Nothing gets me more excited than discussing technologies with my peers or explaining concepts without that background!

Outside of my career in technology, in my free time I love to work on personal projects that teach me new skills. You can see more of these in my projects section. Another one of my favorite things is exercising and self-improvement. I also have a huge passion for music and songwriting, traveling and going on adventures. Most of all I love to spend time with my family and friends.
