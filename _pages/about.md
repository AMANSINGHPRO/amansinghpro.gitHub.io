Hi!

I'm Aman, a pursuing Sales Engineer with an aspiration of blending technology and business together! Before entering College, I always had an inner passion to think of ideas and bring them to life- at school, I accumulated the skills to bring my Computer Projects to life. Nothing gets me more excited than discussing technologies with my peers or explaining concepts to those without that background! Additionally, I take an active role with the mentorship program at the College of Engineering where I mentor many undergraduate students and organize events to spread awareness of resources for students. 

Outside of my career in technology, in my free time I love to work on personal projects that teach me new skills which you can take a look at in <a href="https://colefeely6.github.io/projects/">projects section<a>. Another one of my favorite things is exercising and self-improvement. I also have a huge passion for music and songwriting, traveling, reading and going on adventures. Most of all, I love to spend time with my girlfriend, family, and friends!
