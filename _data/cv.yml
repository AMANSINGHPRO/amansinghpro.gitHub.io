    - title: Data Scientist
      institution: Hannover Re, Dublin, Ireland
      year: December 2022 - Present
      description:
        -	Developed end to end machine learning services for accessing/declining applications for Life and Health business. Implemented data science lifecycle for electronic health records including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, machine learning model development using GBDT algorithms, feature engineering, optimisation etc. Technologies used include AWS stack, AWS Lambda, API Gateway, Microservices, Service oriented architecture, AutoML etc. Product developed was a “green field” award winning project in financial services aimed to significantly reduce time spent by underwriters on accessing risk profiles of thousands of cases.


    - title: Senior Data Scientist
      institution: SleepScore Labs, Dublin, Ireland
      year: Aug 2021- Oct. 2022
      description:
        - Developed Sleep Phenotype Clustering tool using several state of the art dimensionality reduction techniques including UMAP, t-sne etc. paired with clustering algorithms including DBSCAN, DPGMM etc. Tool helped multiple teams in identifying user phenotype which led sleep science team to focus on users at risk and marketing team to recommend relevant products which improve sleep.
        - Developed end to end platform for screening and flagging of sleep disorders among population using machine learning algorithms including LightGBM, XGBoost etc. Followed Data Science Lifecycle and MLOps practices, managed models using version control, exposed models as REST API to be used in application in real-time mode.
        - Sleep Efficiency Prediction Tool Developed a tool to predict sleep efficiency among population of users tracking various sleep parameters using a non-contact technology. Models deployed in cloud using Microsoft Azure. 
        - Researched and published in sleep medicine Journals including Sleep 2022 and European Sleep Research Society. Analysed, visualised and performed inferential statistics on objective data from app users to scientifically validate patters among population. Used modules including statsmodels, seaborn etc and performed hypothesis tests for significance.
        - Developed A/B testing tools for marketing and product team to validate and test various hypothesis in user data to make decisions scientifically. Product team used the tool to find gaps in app user journey. Worked with web user data from Amplitude to help teams make data driven decisions.
        - Analysed, visualised and presented data from hundreds of thousands of users, on ad-hoc requests from marketing team to help them understand user behaviour and run business accordingly. Co-Developed end of year report for an external partner comparing differences between sleeping patterns among users pre and post pandemic.
