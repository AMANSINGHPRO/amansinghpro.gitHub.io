The following is a quote from "Tuesdays with Morrie"


***



> These people were so hungry for love that they were accepting substitutes. They were embracing material things and expecting a sort of hug back. But it never works. You can’t substitute material things for love or for gentleness or for tenderness or for a sense of comradeship.
> —Morrie Schwartz
