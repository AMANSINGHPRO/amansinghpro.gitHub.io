> **STEM-Lord**\n **1.** A person, typically in studying or working in either the Science, Technology, Engineering or Math (STEM) fields who believe they are intellectually superior to their peers and especially those not in STEM and talk down to others because of this prenotion. They most often cannot have a conversation with another that doesn't pertain to themselves, their grades, studies or their job. They are usually very insecure people who feel the need to put down others to make themselves feel better.
